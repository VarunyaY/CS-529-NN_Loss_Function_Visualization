Schedule for the first checkpoint:

• Analyze the existing data, pre-process and change the format so that it can be used easily for visualization.
• Bring in more data if needed by executing the algorithms in PyTorch (Python).
• Write atleast one scenario in the functional specifications document.
• Meet with the teammates to create prototypes (two) using FdS methodology.
• Group discussion about the next set of deliverables.
